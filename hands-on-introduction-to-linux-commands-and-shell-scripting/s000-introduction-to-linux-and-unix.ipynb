    "* It’s **multi-user** - Linux is designed to support multiple users accessing the system simultaneously.\n",
    "* It supports **multitasking** - running multiple jobs and applications at the same time.\n",
    "* It’s **portable** - Linux has been ported to run on many different types of devices and hardware platforms, from desktops to servers to appliances.\n"

    "* It is known for being **stable**, **reliable**, and **fully open source**.\n",
    "* It supports many computer architectures (or types of hardware). \n",

    "* The unique, do-it-yourself approach of Arch Linux allows users to customize every part of their system.\n",
    "* This makes it highly configurable, a freedom that makes Arch very popular.\n",
    "* But it also means that you need a strong understanding of Linux and system tools to use Arch effectively.\n",
    "* Because Arch isn’t focused on stability in the same way as other distros, it has easy access to the newest software, which has little guarantee of being completely stable.\n"
